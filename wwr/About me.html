    <p>I'm from India and i've traveled 20 hours just to be here at BYUI! And im only 18!</p>
    <p>I was born in the church and i try to maintain christlike attributes and so i definitely plan on serving a mission in the coming year.</p>
    <p>I love music, which is why i joined music production for a few years during high school and worked under a few artists for while.</p>
    <p>other than music, i love watching movies and reading books on greek mythology. i spend most of my time infront of a screen trying to learn new things.</p>
