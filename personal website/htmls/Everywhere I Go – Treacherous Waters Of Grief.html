	<p>everywhere i go<br>i see men<br>some, who are taller<br>some, who are poor<br>some, who are stronger<br>some, who donâ€™t complain<br>some, who are fat<br>some, who speak the truth<br>some, who lie</p>



<p>everywhere i go<br>i see men<br>men, who are slimmer<br>men, who are richer<br>men, who are blessed<br>men, who work harder<br></p>



<p>and, everywhere i go<br>a part of me wishes i could be them<br>something from him,<br>the strength from him<br>the wisdom from him<br>the happiness from him</p>



<p>everywhere i go<br>i wish i was not myself<br>i wish i was kinder<br>i wish i listened<br>i wish i spoke<br>i wish i forgave quicker<br>i wish i could cry<br></p>



<p>i walk the roads in my neighbourhood late in the evening<br>the light from the vehicles headlights hit the back of my head from my eyes<br>i can hear myself struggling to let some light kiss my insides<br>i see kids my age, boys, who- <br>are better than me<br>i see them talk to girls in their evening tuition classes<br>i see the girls blush<br>and i wonder if i could be him<br>i wonder if i could attend those classes and be smarter<br>i wonder if im in need of a retired woman teaching me what i already know-<br>i wonder if i realise it is the truth, that i am not capable<br></p>



<p>i walk back home and i see myself walk towards me<br>he looks the same, no better<br>not happy<br>nor sad<br>nor taller<br>nor stronger<br>nor smarter,<br>as he reaches towards me he says<br></p>


<p>"everywhere i go,<br>i see you and i am reminded i am not enough"</p>
